# AV-Research-Work  
**Artificial Intelligence and Robust Decision-Making for Autonomous Vehicles**

---

## Abstract
This repository contains implementations and experimental studies focused on reinforcement learning (RL) methods for autonomous vehicle (AV) decision-making. The work explores both value-based and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms with an emphasis on robustness and performance under varying conditions.
---

## Methods and Algorithms
The repository includes implementations and experimental evaluations of the following reinforcement learning approaches:

- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**
- **Optimized DQN variants**
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
- **Reinforcement learning models implemented using Stable Baselines and Gymnasium**

Each method is evaluated through training performance, and reward progression.
